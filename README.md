The main idea of this app is to provide a tool for a user who doesn't know what to make for food but have some ingredients that he/she would like to use in a meal.

App is structured into two tabs, which can be found on the bottom of the screen:

Search tab:
User can choose a number of ingredients by tapping green '+' button in the initial screen. After each addition, the app suggests a number of different recipes. Each recipe can then be explored furhter by tapping on one of the rows. It gives details about the recipe as well as provides a URL for instructions. User can also save the recipe to favorites by tapping 'Save' button on top right corner.

Favorites tab:
The app provides a functionality of storing recipes for the future use. The user can go to favorites and see recipes he/she liked.

Bon appetit!
